<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone reading this, I am Ritul Ingole just a curious enthusiast. I am persuing Computer Engineering at SCOE, Pune.
  Am currently in my freshman year. And this is my  first project made using basic HTML bcz I know basics only. But I have a 
  keen intrest in Web-Development, like how this websites are built and how does things work at the backend of the websites.
  And I also wanna learn how to design these websites, how to make these all kind of animations and cool effects when someone
  visits our websites. I like the fluid and smooth transitons on the websites, and it actually fasinates me. I want to learn 
  how to maintain the website & keep it running and prevent it from crashing and to make sure it handle traffic or the load 
  which increases as the number of the people who are visiting and are online on our websites increases and importantly make 
  the easily available to all the people in the world who has aacces to the internet.</p>
